# Sentiment Analysis using LSTM and Embedding Layer

This notebook aims at designing a relatively simple LSTM network including embedding layer for the task of sentiment analysis. Working toward this goal, the following topics is going to be discussed.

- Concept of Sentiment Analysis
- Loading and inspecting IMDB movie review dataset
- Concept of Word Embedding
- Discussing CBOW and Skip Gram word embedding models
- Visualizing word embedding using t-SNE
- Designing LSTM network with Embedding layer as part of architecture
- Designing LSTM network on top pre-trained Google embedding model
